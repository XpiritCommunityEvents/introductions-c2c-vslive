Hi. My name is Josh Buck and I hail from teh great state of Maine.

I ahve been doing coding of one sort of another since 1994 when I worked in COBOL for the USAF providing budget and payroll support. Since then I have moved on to Powerbuilder, Visual Basic 6, various floavors of SQL programming. 

Currently I have an ancient VB6 app that I support alnong with a handful of .Net windows and web applications using mostly C# anf F#

I work for a quasi-state agency caled FAME. We are responsible for growing business and education in the state through Grants, Loans, financial backing, etc.
